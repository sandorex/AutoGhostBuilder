# AutoGhostBuilder

Early construction bot replacement mod for [Factorio](https://factorio.com), which automatically builds ghosts from your cursor

**TODO: ADD GIF HERE**

The current version target is `2.0+`

This mod is a fork of [AutoGhostBuilder](https://github.com/kb714/AutoGhostBuilder) made by [@kb714](https://github.com/kb714)

## Goal

The mod is an attempt to make automated construction available in early-ish game without being so overpowered the bots were unecessary
